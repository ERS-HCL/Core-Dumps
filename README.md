# Core-Dumps
Handling Core-Dumps in Kubernetes Cluster inside GCP
Here, in this repository..I am uploading a tutorial doc which will tell us step by step on how to handle core-dumps 
which are created in our application in a Container World.

We have taken a use case from Application Pod deployed in a Kubernetes CLuster in GCP.

I intentionally not putting much YAML files so that user's can go through and practise the steps as denoted in this tutorial.

Hope this may help somebody in their use-cases.
